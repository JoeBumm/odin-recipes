Welcome to my first indvidual project using html. I'm following the Odin Project
I'm so excited for it. I will make a website using all the html tags and attributes i have learned.

I Want to build a goal tracker and self-imporvement websites. I want to follow the fastlane on my work enviorment. I want to be an entrepunier. I want to make people work for me not the other way around. I want to travel out of this Egyptian Country, and I want to marry Lojain.

Tchuss.
